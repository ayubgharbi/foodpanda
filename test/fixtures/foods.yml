  title: 'Pan Pizza - Margarita'

       Here is the archetype of a thin-crust pizza pie, a pizza margherita
       adorned simply in the colors of the Italian flag green from basil,
       white from mozzarella, red from tomato sauce. This pizza is adapted
       from the recipe used by the staff at Roberta’s restaurant in Brooklyn,
       who make their tomato sauce simply by whizzing together canned tomatoes,
       a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt. The ingredients offer in their
       proportions what appears to be a kind of austerity — not even 3 ounces of
       cheese! But the result is home-cooked pizza to beat the band, exactly the
       sort of recipe to start a career in home pizza-making, and to return to
       again and again
